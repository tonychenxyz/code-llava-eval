      "code": "A personalized LLM should remember user facts, apply them correctly, and adapt over time to provide responses that the user prefers. Existing LLM personalization benchmarks are largely centered on two axes: accurately recalling user information and accurately applying remembered information in downstream tasks. We argue that a third axis, likability, is both subjective and central to user experience, yet under-measured by current benchmarks.\n\nTo measure likability holistically, we introduce LikeBench1, a multi-session, dynamic evaluation framework that measures likability across multiple dimensions by how much an LLM can adapt over time to a user’s preferences to provide more likable responses.\n\nIn LikeBench, the LLMs engage in conversation with a simulated user and learn preferences only from the ongoing dialogue. As the interaction unfolds, models try to adapt to responses, and after each turn, they are evaluated for likability across seven dimensions by the same simulated user.\n\nTo the best of our knowledge, we are the first to decompose likability into multiple diagnostic metrics:\n  - emotional adaptation\n  - formality matching\n  - knowledge adaptation\n  - reference understanding\n  - conversation length fit\n  - humor fit\n  - callback\nwhich makes it easier to pinpoint where a model falls short.\n\nTo make the simulated user more realistic and discriminative, LikeBench uses fine-grained, psychologically grounded descriptive personas rather than the coarse high/low trait rating based personas used in prior work.\n\nOur benchmark shows that strong memory performance does not guarantee high likability: DeepSeek R1, with lower memory accuracy (86%, 17 facts/profile), outperformed Qwen3 by 28% on likability score despite Qwen3’s higher memory accuracy (93%, 43 facts/profile). Even SOTA models like GPT-5 adapt well in short exchanges but show only limited robustness in longer, noisier interactions.",

      "code": "One afternoon, a pilot was flying a small airplane when it suddenly ran out of gas. As he was coming in for an emergency landing, the plane crossed into a neighboring state at a very low altitude. At this time, a 9-year-old boy was walking to school when he was struck and injured by an object, which may have fallen from the plane. In federal court, a negligence suit was brought against the pilot by the father of the boy for his son. Accompanied by his father, the boy had visited an attorney for preliminary discussions regarding the case. However, the father did not retain the attorney to represent his son in the lawsuit. Instead, the father hired another lawyer to handle the case. At trial, the pilot's attorney calls the consulting attorney to testify what the boy had said to him regarding his physical condition during the consultation that the attorney had had with the boy and his father. The attorney's testimony is\n\nA.admissible, because the attorney-client privilege was waived by the filing of the lawsuit.\nB.admissible, because there is no privilege of confidentiality when a person other than the client is present at the attorney-client consultation.\nC.inadmissible, because the attorney-client privilege prevents such a breach of confidential communications.\nD.inadmissible, because it was a statement of physical condition not made for the purpose of obtaining medical treatment.",
